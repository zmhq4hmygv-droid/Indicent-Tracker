# Incident Tracker 🚨

An automated system that monitors Swedish police events and sends email
notifications to registered users, based on their municipality (kommun).

**Live site:** _add URL once launched_

## About the project

Incident Tracker lets anyone in Sweden — from central Stockholm to small
towns in Skåne or Umeå — sign up with their kommun and get notified by
email when a relevant police-reported incident happens nearby. No app,
no login, no real-time push notifications — just a clean summary when
something is actually worth knowing about.

## How it works

1. A user signs up on the website with their name, email, and kommun.
2. A GitHub Action runs `send_email.py` every 5 minutes.
3. The script fetches new events from the [Swedish Police API](https://polisen.se/api/events).
4. Relevant, recent crimes (last 24h) are matched against each user's
   kommun and sent via email.

## Features

- National coverage — all 290 Swedish kommuner, not just Stockholm
- Duplicate-safe signups (unique email constraint)
- Filters out irrelevant/administrative police reports (training,
  press briefings, controls) and only sends genuine crime-related events
- Tracks already-sent events so no one gets the same alert twice
- Simple, dependency-light backend — no third-party auth or database
  service required

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.9 (Flask, SQLite)
- Vanilla HTML / CSS / JavaScript (no frontend framework)
- GitHub Actions (scheduling)
- Gmail SMTP

```

## Setup

1. Host `backend/app.py` somewhere persistent (Render, Railway, Fly.io —
   all have free tiers). Running it only locally means GitHub Actions
   can't reach it.
2. Add these as GitHub Secrets:
   - `API_URL` — your hosted backend URL
   - `EMAIL_SENDER` — the sending Gmail address
   - `EMAIL_PASSWORD` — a Gmail App Password (Google Account → Security → App passwords)
3. Update `API_URL` in `frontend/script.js` to point to the hosted backend.
4. Deploy `frontend/` to any static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).

## What I learned

Migrating this project away from Firebase gave me a better understanding of:

- Designing a minimal REST API with Flask and SQLite
- Handling validation and duplicate-prevention without a managed database
- Separating frontend, backend, and a scheduled worker into clean,
  independently deployable pieces
- Securing secrets properly (removing a hardcoded Gmail app password
  that had been committed to the repo)

## Future improvements

- Move from SQLite to a hosted Postgres instance for reliability across
  deploys
- Add an unsubscribe/settings page for users to update or remove their
  kommun
- Rate-limit signups and add basic bot protection
- Improve micro-location matching (neighborhood-level detail for
  Stockholm, Göteborg, Malmö) on top of kommun-level alerts

## Status

In development — backend rebuilt on Flask/SQLite, frontend rebuilt in
vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. Not yet launched publicly.
